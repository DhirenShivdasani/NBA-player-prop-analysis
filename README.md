# NBA Player Prop Analyzer

## Description
This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that monitors and visualizes real-time changes in current NBA player data. It's designed to help users track significant changes in data size and structure and visualize these changes through graphical representations. This tool is particularly useful for data analysts and scientists looking to maintain high data integrity and make informed decisions based on the latest data insights. Note: Since this web app works with current NAB data, it will only work during the NBA season.
